/**
 * Creates a store based on expo-secure-store, that handles the 2048 size limit on values.
 *
 * The store uses a queue to manage multiple save requests and two slots (A and B) to store the key-value pairs.
 * The function alternates between the two slots to save the key-value pairs and splits the value into chunks to save them.
 * The two slots are used to handle corrupted data or incomplete saves.
 *
 * The keys used are the following:
 * - key-latest -> 'A'/'B'
 * - key-{A/B}-metadata -> Metadata
 * - key-{A/B}-chunk-{i} -> data chunk
 * - key-{A/B}-complete -> 'true'/'false'
 *
